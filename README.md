***The backend "ResizeWebApi" project, built with ASP.NET Core in C#, manages rectangle dimensions via a dedicated controller. It offers endpoints for retrieving and updating dimensions stored in a JSON file. Error logging is implemented for robust monitoring, and CORS middleware enables communication with the frontend, specifically allowing requests from http://localhost:4200. This concise backend setup ensures efficient management of rectangle data and smooth interaction between frontend and backend components.***
